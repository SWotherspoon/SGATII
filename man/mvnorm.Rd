\usage{
mvnorm(S, s = 1, n = 1, tol = 1e-06)

bmvnorm(S, m, s = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{a covariance matrix or an array of covariance matrices.}

\item{s}{a scale factor applied to S.}

\item{n}{number of deviates to draw.}

\item{tol}{minimum allowable variance.}

\item{m}{dimension of each deviate.}
}
\value{
A function that draws bivariate Normal deviates with mean
given by its first argument.
}
\description{
Construct a sampler to draw multivariate Normal deviates.
}
\details{
Construct a sampler that draws Multivariate Normal deviates with
covariances determined by \code{S} and mean determined by its
first argument.

The \code{mvnorm} function constructs a function that generates \code{n}
independent Multivariate Normal deviates, where the covariance of
each deviate is specified by \code{S} which must be either a \code{m}x\code{m}
covariance matrix or an \code{n}x\code{m}x\code{m} array of covariance matrices.

The \code{bmvnorm} function constructs a function that generates \code{n}
correlated Multivariate Normal deviates, where the joint
covariance is specified by \code{S} which must be a \code{nm}x\code{nm}
covariance matrix (as generated by \code{chainBcov}).
